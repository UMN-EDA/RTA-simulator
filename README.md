Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) involves the application of high temperature
for a short period to perform dopant activation, and is an important process
step. It is critically important to ensure that annealing occurs uniformly across
the entire die. This repository contains software to perform thermal analysis to determine the temperature profile of a die under RTA, considering radiation and conduction effects.

The software solves builds and solves the following differential equation to generate the on-die temperature profile:

## Tutorial

### Prerequisites
+ python 3.6.3
+ pip 21.2.3

### Download and install on machine
Clone the repository using the following commands and change directory to RTA-simulator home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/UMN-EDA/RTA-simulator.git
cd RTA-simulator
```

To install RTA-simulator create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the python pacakges needed using the following commands (working interent connection is needed to download and install the python pacakges listed in the requirements.txt file):

```
python3 venv -m UMN-RTA
source UMN-RTA/bin/activate.csh # if bash ./UMN-RTA/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
TherMOS requires a model_parameter file, example [model_parameter_FinFET.json](input/model_parameter_FinFET.json), file which specifies the various parameters of
the device in consideration. The default parameters in the file 
[model_parameter_FinFET.json](input/model_parameter_FinFET.json) and 
[model_parameter_MOSFET.json](input/model_parameter_MOSFET.json) for a planar 7nm FinFET and 14nm FDSOI planar MOSFET technology and are
obtained from literature sources as documented in [FinFET_parameters.md](doc/FinFET_parameters.md) and  [MOSFET_parameters.md](doc/MOSFET_parameters.md) respectively.

TherMOS can be used as follows:

`python3 src/TherMOS.py <process_type> -device_type <str> -n_gate <int>  -power <float> [-n_fin <int> | -width <float>] -active "<int_list>" -percent "<float_list>"`

| Argument              	| Comments                                                                             	|
|-----------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| -h, --help            	| Prints out the usage                                                                 	|
| <process_type>        	| Process and technology specification (str, required)                                 	|
| -device_type <str>      | NMOS or PMOS device type (required, str)                                              |
| -n_gate <int>         	| Specifies the number of transistors in the simulation (int, required)                	|
| -power <float>        	| Specifies the total power dissipated by the array of transistors(s)                   	|
| -n_fin <int>          	| Number of fins in FinFET (required, int, use only when   <process_type> is FinFET)   	|
| -width <float>        	| Width of the MOSFET (required, float, use only when process is MOSFET)               	|
| -active    "int_list" 	| States the list of gate ids that are dissipating power (list of int,   optional)     	| 
| -percent "float_list" 	| Percentage of power distributed between the active gates (optional,   list_of_float) 	|



After TherMOS completes execution, it generates a temperature report in the
output directory which contains the the maximum, and the average temperature rise in
the transistor(s).

To view a graphic of temperature distribution within the transistor(s):

```
cd scripts
octave -r -nodisplay 'visualize_T';
```

The following outputs are generated by TherMOS:

- [temperature.rpt](output/temperature.rpt): a report which states the maximum, minimum and average
  temperature of all the devices simulated.
- [T.out](output/T.out): a python object which is an array of temperatures that can be used in
  Octave to plot the temperature profile.
- [T.png](output/T.png): an image with the 3D temperature contour plot of the simulated
  devices.
